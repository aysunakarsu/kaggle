# kaggleÂ¶
This notebook demonstrates how to test a flower classifier and produces a submission.csv file for submitting to the kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/oxford-102-flower-pytorch. The notebook is directly accessible on google colab. The classifier is trained elsewhere, in this notebook it will be loaded from a saved checkpoint on google drive. This kaggle competition uses the same datasets as in Udacity Facebook Pytorch Challenge final project.

The data originally comes from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/. There are 102 flower categories, and the test dataset contains 819 test images. For this competition the labels of the test dataset are not provided.
